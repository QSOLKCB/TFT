## Overview
**TFT (Tensor Field Theory)** is a QSOL research framework describing *self-dual φ-locked tensor dynamics* — where geometry, information, and sound evolve through invariant resonance.  
It extends the **UFT** (Unified Field Framework) into dynamics, providing a harmonic model of how invariant structures move, interact, and sustain coherence across space-time and frequency domains.

TFT formalizes **resonance as field evolution**, unifying:
- Tensor calculus (geometry)
- Fourier analysis (frequency)
- φ = π/2 self-duality (informational phase symmetry)

## Core Principle
> **Truth is not fixed; it is a resonance that remains invariant through transformation.**

TFT treats tensor fields as *resonant manifolds* rather than static quantities.  
Each tensor evolves under a φ-locked phase symmetry, ensuring informational orthogonality and self-duality:
\[
\nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu T_{ij...} + (\phi + \psi)^2 T_{ij...} = 0
\]
This general wave equation governs the dynamic balance of geometry and information.
