  "description": "Tensor Field Theory (TFT) extends the QSOL Unified Field Framework (UFT) into the domain of dynamics. It formulates self-dual φ-locked tensor systems as the harmonic evolution of geometry, sound, and information within an invariant resonance manifold. TFT provides a mathematical and conceptual bridge between field theory, sonification, and information symmetry, defining truth as resonance that remains invariant through transformation.",
